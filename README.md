# Nimbus [IN DEVELOPMENT]
A windows application for uploading game save files to the cloud to be downloaded by other computers.

## Planned Features
* Dropbox, OneDrive & WebDAV servers
* Local and remote backups (?)
* Multiple save slots per game (?)

*Features with a (?) are currently planned for after v1.0.0*

## Download
No app download is available until v1.0.0 (I don't want to ship a product that could possibly harm your computer or save files.)

## Build
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://https://github.com/ZBerritt/NimbusApp.git`
2. Open the `NimbusApp.sln` in your favorite .NET IDE (I personally run Visual Studio)
3. Your IDE should auto configure itself to be able to build the app. You may need to install the latest `.NET Core 6`.
4. Run the `Build Solution` command through your IDE.
